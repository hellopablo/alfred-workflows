# Open [Repository] Folder

Opens up `~/Sites/GitRepos` in finder from a keyword. I know this is built-in functionality, but I found typing `repos` wouldn't always give me the exact folder I wanted (despite the screenshot showing otherwise >_<). This changes that. The alt command will open the `origin` in the default browser.

    repos

You can copy the existing nodes in the workflow and add more keyword aliases if needed, too.

# Alfred Workflows

A bunch of workflows for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com) which make my life easier, use any of them if you want!

These are all customised to my machine (I'm treating this repo as a backup mainly), but easily adjusted to another environment.

Some more useful repos can be found at [Shed](https://github.com/shedhq/alfred-workflows).


## Open [Repository] Folder

Opens up `~/Sites/GitRepos` in finder from a keyword. I know this is built-in functionality, but I found typing `repos` wouldn't always give me the exact folder I wanted (despite the screenshot showing otherwise >_<). This changes that.

You can copy the existing nodes in the workflow and add more keyword aliases if needed, too.

## Copy `now()` to clipboard

Copies the current time to the clipboard, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (useful for pasting into databases etc). Optionally specify the timezone as an argument (defaults to UTC).
